== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a Wishpond account set up already? =

No, your account is automatically created through the plugin, or you can simply use an existing account.

= Do I need to know how to code or design? =

Not at all! Wishpond's opt-in bar builder (with optimized templates already set up for you) was created specifically so no coding or design knowledge is required.

= Can I use the opt-in bars Builder plugin for free? =

Absolutely! You can create and publish your opt-in bars for free until you've generated 200 leads. You will need to upgrade to generate more. You can learn more about our pricing [here](https://www.wishpond.com/pricing/ "Pricing").

= Do I need to set up any Wordpress configuration options for this plugin? =

All you need is to make sure that the Permalinks are set to "Post Name" or "Custom Structure". Verify your permalink settings in Settings->Permalinks.

= Where are opt-in bars stored? =

Your opt-in bars are stored on Wishpond. This also means that if you ever uninstall this plugin, your Wishpond account still has your work.

= How do I delete an opt-in bar? =

After you create an opt-in bar, you can view it under "Dashboard." To delete it, simply select the gear icon on the right and click "Delete".

= What URL should I use when creating a opt-in bar? =

When creating an opt-in bar you have to make sure you use the domain of the Wordpress page you are on, followed by the path on which you want the opt-in bar to be hosted. So if my Wordpress site is at "http://www.wishpond.com" and I want to host my opt-in bar at "new-landing-page," then I would use the following url "http://www.wishpond.com/new-landing-page".

= What if my Wordpress site is on a multi-site installation? =

If your Wordpress site is hosted under a multi-site installation, then your Wordpress path would be preceeded by your site's domain. For example, if your Wordpress site is hosted at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/" then you can host an opt-in bar at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/landing-page"

= I can't publish a opt-in bar, what's wrong? =

When editing an opt-in bar, make sure the URL you specify begins with the same domain name and protocol (http or https) as your Wordpress site. In other words, if your Wordpress site is hosted at "https://my-wordpress-site.com" you can't use "http://my-wordpress-site.com" or "https://www.my-wordpress-site.com" or any other variation.

= I have another question, what do I do? =
